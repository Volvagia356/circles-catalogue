# Circles Catalogue

Static single-page web catalogue of event booths.

Originally built and demonstrated for Visual Arts Expo 2018, but never completed or used.

## Data files

Data files (excluding images) from VAX2018 are provided as an example in the `data` directory.

The final `data.json` file is generated by running the following scripts in order:

```
categories.py
fandoms.py
groups.py
find_images.py
merge.py
```

## Building

Running `dist.sh` will gather files into the `dist` directory in a form ready to be published on a static web server.
